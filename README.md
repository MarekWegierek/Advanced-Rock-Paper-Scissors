# Advanced Rock Paper Scissors Project in vanilla JavaScript 

## This is a base model project, created with intention to translate it in the future to React and React Native to mobile app

This is my first semi-serious project, where I didn't follow any tutorials from YT and just try to make it as best I'can do at this moment in my life.

## What this app will do?

It is a advanced version of Paper Rock Scissor Game, where to standard three option, I've added 12 new option to chose from during game. It might be played as standard game (against computer oponent) but I will mainly focus on making it as a functional guide to solve nerd conflicts on parties with no bitches. My roadmap to this project looks like that:

* v0.1 functional desktop version of app (we are here)
* v0.2 mobile browser version 
* v0.3 option of playing with computer
* v0.4 3 different modes of game to choose from
* v0.5 Day/Night Mode interface
* v0.6 Player vs Player Mode
* v0.7 Add Difficulty Levels for playing with computer
* v0.8 Add sound effects 
* v0.9 Fix any problems, that might happend in the meantime
* v1.0 Final version
